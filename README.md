# EatWays

This is a food and travel app in which the user could input the restaurants they want to try on their "Restaurants" list, and places they want to visit on their "Places" list.
When the user click on a place in their Places list, it will display the address, nearby restaurants (that are on their list), and the distance from the place to the restaurant.
Vice versa, when they click on the restaurant, it will display the same information but for nearby places.
